WindowStyleTest
===============

test repo for WindowStyle="None"


- Move the maximized window to other monitor with ```SHIFT+WIN+LEFT``` or ```SHIFT+WIN+RIGHT```
- Now the window should be moved to the other monitor and still maximized
- Try to move the window back to the previous/first monitor with ```SHIFT+WIN+LEFT``` or ```SHIFT+WIN+RIGHT```
- So you wondered why nothing happens? The window doesn't move again!
- Me too :-D
- Test system: Windows 7 64 bit .NET 4.5.1
